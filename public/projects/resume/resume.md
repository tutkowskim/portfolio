#### Resume
A resume is the one of the first items a potential employer sees when reviewing an application, so this is the perfect place to showcase your talents. My resume is written in react and uses a continuous integration pipeline to build, generate a PDF, and publish to [https://www.resume.tutkowski.com](https://www.resume.tutkowski.com)

<br><br>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <!-- note: Image is editable in draw.io -->
  <img src="/projects/resume/resume-build-process.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" />
</div>
<br><br>

Not only does this approach show off my skill sets as a developer, but since I'm using version control to store my resume I can review previous revisions of my resume with ease.
