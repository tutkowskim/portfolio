#### Task Tracker
My very first React application which keeps track a list of items that I would like to complete. Despite several TODO applications available on the web, I wrote my own in order to explore React and Azure serverless functions.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; background: gray; padding: 10px">
  <!-- note: Image is editable in draw.io -->
  <img src="/projects/task-tracker/task-tracker.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;" />
</div>
