#### Scrum Poker
A light weight scrum poker planning application. I was motivated to create this application, because the scrum poker app that I had been using started to slow down with un-needed animations and ads, so I decided to create my own. The application consists of the deck view and the card view.

<br>

The deck view is loaded when the application first launches and displays all of the available cards to choose from in the deck.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="/projects/scrum-poker/deck-view.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" />
</div>
<br><br>

The card view appears after the user has selected a card from the deck and is what the user will show their teammates during the planning process.
