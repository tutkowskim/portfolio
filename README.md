## Building
This project is written using react, so you will need have nodejs installed and run the following commands to start the development server.

```
npm install;
npm start;
```

## Motivation
I've always been interested in having my own website, however I wasn't sure what I wanted my web presence to be. While learning about the react framework I decided to apply what I was learning to create a portfolio website to showcase my personal projects. In the future this may morph into a blog, however for now it is a landing page for things I've accomplished.
